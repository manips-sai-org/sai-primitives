# sai2-primitives
This is a control library that provides an implementation of basic tasks and controllers for a torque controlled robot.
It uses the Operatinal Space framework.
It offers the possibility to be used with the [Ruckig](https://ruckig.com/) for trajectory generation (community version).

Robot controllers can be defined using different tasks:
- The MotionForce task is a cartesian control task, defined on a robot and a compliant frame:
    - It can be full 6dof (translation and rotation) or a subset of the cartesian motions (for example a planar transation and 1 rotation in that plane)
    - It can be set to use operational space control or impedance control
    - Any direction (defined in robot base frame or compliant frame) can be parametrized to perform force control instead of motion control
    - Force control can be open loop or closed loop with passivity based stabilization (https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7989050, https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8206036)
- The joint task implements PD control to control the joint positions of a torque controlled robot:
    - It can be full or defined on a subset of the joints
    - It can be parametrixed to use dynamic decoupling or not

The robot controller then takes a list of tasks and implements a hierarchical controller using all the tasks to compute the robot control torques

## Dependencies
sai2-primitives depends on sai2-model, Eigen3 and Ruckig.

The examples depend on additional libraries : sai2-simulation, sai2-graphics, sai2-common.

## Build instructions
First build ruckig:
```
cd ruckig
mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. && make -j4
cd ../..
```
Next, build sai2-primitives
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. && make -j4
```

## Run the examples
Remember that you need sai2-simulation, sai2-graphics and sai2-common in order to compile and run the examples.
Go to build/examples/desired_example and run the example. For example 1 :
```
cd build/examples/01-joint_control
./01-joint_control
```
